    Keywords
    Keywords are the reserved words in Python. We cannot use the keyword as a variable, function name or any identifiers name.
    all keywords in lowercase letter except(True, False, None)
        False	    await	    else	    import	  pass
        None	    break	    except	  in	      raise
        True	    class	    finally	  is	      return
        and	      continue	for	      lambda	  try
        as	      def	      from	    nonlocal	while
        assert	  del	      global	  not	      with
        async	    elif	    if	      or	      yield

    variable:
        a = 50
        city = "Bhopal"
        res = True
        marks = 20.6
        a = "John"
        _enroll = 123456789
    Literals:
            any raw value which is assigned in any variable or constant
    constants:
            constant a type of variable but with fixed value.
            there is no scope of constant in python.
            COLLEGE = "LNCT"
            CITY = "BHOPAL"
            COLLEGE = "JNCT"

    Identifiers:
        A python identifiers is a name used to identify a variable, function,
        class, module, or any other object.

        rules to declare identifiers name:
                1. not start with digits[0-9]
                2. can not contain any space
                3. can not contain any special character (_)
                4. should not use keywords in identifiers name.
                5. class name start with a uppercase letter and all identifiers
                    with a lowercase letter.
                6. starting an identifier with a single underscore indicates
                    that identifier is a private.
                        _name = "John"
                7. starting an identifier with two leading underscore indicates
                    that identifier as strongly private identifier.
                        __acc = 235698741520
                8. if the identifier also ends with two trailing underscore, the
                    identifier is a language-defined special name.
                        __name__

                
firstName = "John"
last_name = "Mathew"

name_of_student_from_mumbai = "John" #snake case
nameOfStudentFromMumbai = "John" #camel case
class NameOfStudentFromMumbai: #pascal case
    pass
